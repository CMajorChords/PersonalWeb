I am a graduate student majoring in :orange-background[hydrology], with a research focus on :orange-background[runoff forecasting]. My main interest lies in combining traditional hydrological models (especially the :orange-background[soil moisture accounting model]) with :orange-background[deep learning] models. My research includes embedding prior knowledge of hydrological progress into neural networks, developing specialized network architectures and training methods for runoff simulation. Specifically, this involves using neural networks to address issues such as :orange-background[abrupt changes] in flood forecasting, :orange-background[enhancing forecast lead time], and achieving :orange-background[runoff predicting in ungauged basins].

This website contains two sections: :red-background[Blog] and :red-background[Tools]. In the Blog section, :red-background[Research Progress] will periodically update with :orange-background[Research Code] or :orange-background[Reading Notes]. The :red-background[Technical Notes] include topics not directly related to research but still important, such as Python environment setup, Ubuntu system installation, etc. In the Tools section, the :red-background[AI Assistant] supports interactions with advanced LLM models like GPT4o, GPT4o mini, and others for tasks such as document viewing and conversation. The :red-background[Data Analysis] includes features like data visualization and interpolation. The :red-background[Hydro Model] provide calibration and validation for some traditional hydrological models and deep learning models.
