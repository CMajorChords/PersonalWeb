&emsp;&emsp;
The functionality of this website currently consists of three modules: 
reporting scientific research work,
incorporating hydrological tools, and sharing anything useful.
Share suggestions in[feedback document](https://docs.qq.com/doc/DU21SRXFYbXVBeWtF),
which will be regularly checked and replied.
<h3 style='pointer-events: none;'>3.Why webï¼Ÿ</h3>

&emsp;&emsp;
The technical accumulation of the website 
comes from a crosswise task of my research group,
in which I am mainly responsible for software development.
In order to adapt the software to Chinese domestic operating systems,
I decide to write this software using a web nested Electron framework
after referring to the current mainstream full platform software production solutions 
(such as QQ, etc.).
The crosswise task taught me how to quickly build a data science web.
In order to motivate me in future research careers,
I decide to open a research work module to
report work progress every half month
